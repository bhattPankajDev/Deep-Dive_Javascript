// Scopes in JS 
// Can be understood as the concept of visibility like the region till that something has significance

// Here in programming visibility for variables and fucntions
// Mostly 2 operations happen in code in one of the following 2 ways:
// 1-> Either we are assigning some value
// 2-> Either we are fetching some values
   //Pre to this quesn is => Is JS compiled or interpreted ? 
//    Go to interpret.js and compile.js so we got to know that JS is not completely Inter and completely compiled okay

// So JS have a hybrid architecture means it gets somehow compiled AWA(as well as ) interpreted also 
 
// JS code executes in 2 phases->
//1) Parsing 
//2) Execution
// JS first reda sthe whole code and then does parsing b
// Parsing->  In this the major step happens or the main thing happens is called as scope resolution 
//   Scope resolution means allocating every variable and function the a particular scope where it belongs.
//    4 types of scopes in JS 
//       Global Scope
//       Module Scope

//       Block Scope
